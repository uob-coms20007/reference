# Nondeterministic Finite State Automata

A __Nondeterministic Finite State Automaton (NFA)__ is a 5-tuple of shape:

$$
    (Q,\,\Sigma,\,\delta,\,q_0,\,F)
$$

whose components are restricted and named as follows:
* $Q$ is any *finite* set, called the __states__
* $\Sigma$ is any alphabet
* $\delta : Q \times \Sigma_\epsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is called the __transition function__
* $q_0 \in Q$ is called the __start state__ (or: *initial state*)
* $F \subseteq Q$ are called the __accept states__ (or: *final states*)

We assume that $\epsilon$ does not already occur in $\Sigma$ and then the set $\Sigma_\epsilon$ is just $\Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}$.

## Computation

The __transition system generated by an NFA__ $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ consists of:
  
  * configurations $\\{ (q,w) \mid q \in Q \\}$
  * and the transition relation is the smallest relation such that: 
      - if $q \in \delta(p,a)$ for $a \in \Sigma$, then $(p,aw) \tr (q,w)$
      - and, if $q \in \delta(p,\epsilon)$, then $(p,w) \tr (q,w)$

## Language Represented

Fix an NFA $N = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$.

A word $w$ is __accepted__ by $N$ just if $(q_0,w) \trs (q,\epsilon)$ for some final state $q \in F$.

The language __recognised__ by $N$ is the set $L(M) = \\{w \mid \text{$M$ accepts $w$}\\}$.
