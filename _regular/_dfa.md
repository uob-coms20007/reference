# Deterministic Finite State Automata

A __Deterministic Finite State Automaton (DFA)__ is a 5-tuple of shape:

$$
    (Q,\,\Sigma,\,\delta,\,q_0,\,F)
$$

whose components are restricted and named as follows:
* $Q$ is any *finite* set, called the __states__
* $\Sigma$ is any alphabet
* $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is called the __transition function__
* $q_0 \in Q$ is called the __start state__ (or: *initial state*)
* $F \subseteq Q$ are called the __accept states__ (or: *final states*)


## Computation

The __transition system generated by a DFA__ $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ consists of:
  
  * configurations $\\{ (q,w) \mid q \in Q \wedge w \in \Sigma^* \\}$
  * and the transition relation has $(p,aw) \tr (q,w)$ just if $\delta(p,a) = q$.

## Language Represented

Fix a DFA $M = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$.

A word $w$ is __accepted__  just if $(q_0,w) \trs (q,\epsilon)$ for some final state $q \in F$.

The language __recognised__ is the set $L(M) = \\{w \mid \text{$M$ accepts $w$}\\}$.
