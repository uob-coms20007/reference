Fix a finite alphabet $$\Sigma$$ of characters.    A __regular expression over $\Sigma$__ (equivalently: *regex*), is a tree described by the following grammar:

$$
  R, S ::= \emptyset \mid \epsilon \mid a \mid R \cdot S \mid R + S \mid R^*
$$

For the purpose of understanding the expressions generated by this grammar as trees, we consider each letter $$a \in \Sigma$$ to have arity 0 (i.e. it will be a leaf of the tree), $$\cdot$$ and $$+$$ are binary operators (arity 2), and $$\ ^*$$ is an operator of arity 1 that we happen to write postfix (i.e. after it's argument).

We will use $R$, $S$, $T$, $U$ and other uppercase letters towards the end of the alphabet as variables that stand for regular expressions.
